# Gaming_Hub - a program by TomSwb

## Description

#### Goal:

A small GTK4 window for my laptop screen while I game on the TV or projector. It opens when a game starts, shows what I care about during a session (system stats, headset, break timer, power), keeps a log of my sessions, and acts as the break reminder of my Healthy Gaming Charter.

It is also a learning project: event-driven programming in C with GTK4, GLib/GObject, D-Bus and libpulse, all new to me.

> 🚧 **Work in progress.** Milestone 0 (research, no code) is underway. Nothing runs yet.

#### Brief overview:

The window is snapped to one half of the laptop screen (Super+Left/Right), next to the YouTube Music app on the other half.

| Panel | Shows / does | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stats | CPU % and frequency, GPU frequency and busy %, temperatures, RAM, battery and charger | `/proc`, `/sys/class/drm`, `/sys/class/hwmon`, `/sys/class/power_supply` |
| Headset | Volume, mute, mic volume and mute, battery (if Linux can read it) | PipeWire through libpulse; battery TBD in milestone 0 |
| Timer | Session plan, breaks, wind-down warning, 20-20-20 eye cue, pause button | GLib timers, GtkMediaFile, GNotification |
| Power | Balanced ↔ Performance switch, charger warning | power-profiles D-Bus API (tuned-ppd), UPower |
| Session log | Game, start/end, play time, average fps, max temperature → CSV | Own code, `~/.local/share/gaming_hub/` |
| Game notes | Per-game card: settings that worked, "where I was / what's next" | Text files per game |
| Temp graph | Temperature over the whole session | GtkDrawingArea + Cairo |
| FPS (stretch) | Frame rate and frame time | MangoHud's log, if it can be read live |

**Starts and stops by itself:** every game launches through `gamemoderun`, and GameMode's `[custom] start=` / `end=` hooks run the hub. It is single-instance (GtkApplication), so the end hook just tells the running window to close the session.

**Rule: the hub must not cost fps.** Iris Xe shares one power budget between CPU and GPU, so the hub refreshes once a second, redraws only what changed and has no animations. Checked at milestone 2 and at the end.

`Files:`

* `main.c`: entry point
* `includes/gaming_hub.h`: shared header
* `Makefile`: builds the hub and libft
* `docs/research.md`: what I tested by hand before coding (headset battery over D-Bus, MangoHud logging) and the rules the code must follow

`Additionally contains:`

* `libft/`: my 42 libft (with `ft_printf` and `get_next_line`)

## Instructions

Fedora, with GTK4 and the PulseAudio client library (PipeWire speaks its API):

```bash
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel
make
./gaming_hub
```

The Makefile will get the GTK4 and libpulse flags from `pkg-config` from milestone 1 on. Until then `make` only builds the empty skeleton.

## Milestones

Each one is usable on its own. Full plan: [`docs/game-dashboard.md`](https://github.com/TomSwb/set_up/blob/main/docs/game-dashboard.md) in my set_up repo.

- [ ] 0. Research (no code): headset battery, MangoHud logging
- [ ] 1. Hello window: GtkApplication, main loop, signals, GObject basics
- [ ] 2. Live stats from `/proc` and `/sys` + fps-cost check
- [ ] 3. Timer and healthy-gaming features, settings file
- [ ] 4. Auto-start with GameMode, single instance, `--end`
- [ ] 5. Headset volume and mic with libpulse
- [ ] 6. Power profile and charger over D-Bus
- [ ] 7. Session log, game notes, stop ritual, monthly review
- [ ] 8. Temperature graph with Cairo
- [ ] 9. FPS from MangoHud (stretch)

#### Docs:

* [GTK4](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/), [GLib](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/), [GIO](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/) (GApplication, GDBus, GNotification)
* [libpulse API](https://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/doxygen/)

* `man 5 proc`, kernel docs for `/sys/class/hwmon` and `/sys/class/power_supply`

#### Editor:

* `VSCodium`: Used to avoid Microsoft telemetry and AI-integrated temptations.

### AI:

⚠️ Disclaimer: I only ask for actual answers/solutions when I realise that I am missing theoretical knowledge.

e.g.: a new syntax or a new concept I had not explored previously.

I always write my code to the best of my abilities first.

My AI agents are set to guide me with questions as per the 42 pedagogical philosophy.

I use VSCodium on purpose to not have AI integration. This means that, except for my copy-pastes into chats for some reviews, AI does not see my code, and AI will never write my code - I do not copy-paste from AI into my code.

`Claude:`

1. Teacher: explains the new concepts of each milestone (GTK4, GLib, GObject, D-Bus, libpulse) and points me to the docs, with hints and small examples on other cases, never finished code.
2. Peer reviewer: reviews the code I paste like a 42 correction (bugs, leaks, GObject references, error handling) and asks questions that lead me to the fix.
3. Documentation: writes and keeps up to date this README and the plan in my set_up repo. The code is all mine.
